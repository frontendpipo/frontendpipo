I’m @frontendpipo.
I'm a 21 y/o Software and System Analysis and Development grad student, interested in learning all the tools and tricks in coding as I proceed on my graduation.
I’m currently on my Software Engineering program (where I actually learned how to setup my GitHub profile) and doing some extracurricular courses in Javascript and Structured Query Language (SQL); looking in specializing in back-end dev and database administration as I procceed my graduation, and build my portfolio to apply to intern jobs.
